A person who got existential crisis since age of 10. 
Joined naval forces at age of 18 and resigned at 19. After wandering around and overthinking a lot of nights, finally found some peace of mind.
Read much about stoicism and bible. Able to talk 2 more languages beside English.

Studied Computer Engineering and same time discovered financial instruments as well as cryptocurrencies. After 2 years of constant losing
at 3rd year became breakeven and after 4th year in crypto, became profitable trader. But it wasn't enough, needed new challanges. So, started work on pinescript to build my own tradebots with skills from computer engineering field.

Which ended up succesfuly and even no longer needed to execute trades by myself to make profit. Now was earning while just chilling. 
However, meaning of life is to always move forward, always being busy.
Got any other challenge to build self-sufficient Gen2 memecoin, because a person who has great mind but not keeping himself busy, starts drowning in his own thoughts. When you have an ambition even coldest nights feel warm.
And a soul doesn't attach to a purpose loses its way.
