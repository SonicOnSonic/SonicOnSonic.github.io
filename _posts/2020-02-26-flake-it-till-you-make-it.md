### I've seen Gen1 memecoins fall. 

No matter what they do. Simply because they only depend on hype, community, pump and dump. 
So, as a profitable algo trader, I thought why I just don't create a memecoin that doesn't depend on anything, anyone. 
Logic was simple but hard to achieve, a memecoin that doesn't get flatlined. It shouldn't depend on its community, even own developer.

**As you can see below, all Gen1 memecoins shared same destiny.**

To change the twisted game of memecoins, I decided to build a self-sufficient Gen2 memecoin. 
As you may know, serious projects start with a budget. To be used on team, marketing, costs of VMs etc.
While memecoins launch with almost $0 cost.

**Note:** $SNC is neither of them, or maybe both. 

You heard plant Terrarium experiment right? Where David Latimer put some soil, fertilizer, plant and water. Where ecosystem grewup by itself.
Roughly, $SNC is crypto version of that.

### Income Methods : 

**1-** I put some amount of money (which I totally erased and forgot from my life) to a lot of $S protocols and dApps to earn passively.
\n**2-** Coded a trading strategy on TradingView, connected that to Binance via API Signals. Which trades Bitcoin. 
\n**3-** Will be proposed to holders' decision after launch...

rewards which are received via these sources are in use to buy back & burn $SNC autonomously.
**You don't need to chase KOLs, hype, cults, communities, raids or whatever you call. $SNC works for you while you spend no effort.**

Currently, this mechanism is not fully autonomous and still requires a server to run, and sometimes dev intervention. However, I contacted with Rabby Wallet team. Requested a feature which they also found logical. If this feature will be deployed, then $SNC buy back & burn mechanism will be fully autonomous and independent. Even if dev gets in coma, no worries. It will work as long as $S chain is up and Bitcoin is alive. 

**Below you can see the mechanism behind $SNC**

In situations of no buyers, no hype, no community $SNC will work for increasing its price while reducing the supply, thanks to the its self-sufficient mechanism.
Do you know what that means? If we prolong this for enough time, in theory its market cap can pass all other memecoins.
Mentalities:
- River cuts through rock, not because of its power but because of its persistence.
- Step by step walk thousand-mile road.



You can check out below formulas

$$\text{SNC Total Supply} - \left[\sum_{t=0}^{\text{S Chain Uptime}\left(\infty\right)} f(\text{protocol rewards} \times t) + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} f(\text{trading profits} \times t)\right]$$




I hope you understand what this formula means. Since remaining supply will always decrease, price of $SNC will go up.
as you may see from below formula when we decrease remaining supply, price goes up.

$$\text{Price} = \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Remaining Supply}}$$
