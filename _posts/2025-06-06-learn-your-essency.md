### I've seen Gen1 memecoins fall. 

No matter what they do. Simply because they only depend on hype, community, pump and dump. 
So, as a profitable algo trader, I thought why I just don't create a memecoin that doesn't depend on anything, anyone. 
Logic was simple but hard to achieve, a memecoin that doesn't get flatlined. It shouldn't depend on its community, even own developer.

**As you can see below, all Gen1 memecoins shared same destiny.**

![Lifecycle](/assets/img/1_lifecycle_of_memes.png)



To change the twisted game of memecoins, I decided to build a self-sufficient Gen2 memecoin. 
As you may know, serious projects start with a budget. To be used on team, marketing, costs of VMs etc.
While memecoins launch with almost $0 cost. 

{: .box-note}
**Note:** $SNC is neither of them, or maybe both. 

You heard plant Terrarium experiment right? Where David Latimer put some soil, fertilizer, plant and water. Where ecosystem grewup by itself.
Roughly, $SNC is crypto version of that.

### Income Methods : 

**1-** I put some amount of money (which I totally erased and forgot from my life) to a lot of $S protocols and dApps to earn passively.

**2-** Coded a trading strategy on TradingView, connected that to Binance via API Signals. Which trades Bitcoin. 

**3-** Will be proposed to holders' decision after launch...

rewards which are received via these sources are in use to buy back & burn $SNC autonomously.
**You don't need to chase KOLs, hype, cults, communities, raids or whatever you call. $SNC works for you while you spend no effort.**


{: .box-success}
Currently, this mechanism is not fully autonomous and still requires a server to run, and sometimes dev intervention. However, I contacted with Rabby Wallet team. Requested a feature which they also found logical. If this feature will be deployed, then $SNC buy back & burn mechanism will be fully autonomous and independent. Even if dev gets in coma, no worries. It will work as long as $S chain is up and Bitcoin is alive. 







**Below you can see the mechanism behind $SNC**

In situations of no buyers, no hype, no community $SNC will work for increasing its price while reducing the supply, thanks to the its self-sufficient mechanism.
Do you know what that means? If we prolong this for enough time, in theory its market cap can pass all other memecoins.
Mentalities:
- River cuts through rock, not because of its power but because of its persistence.
- Step by step walk thousand-mile road.



You can check out below formulas

$$\text{SNC Total Supply} - \left[\sum_{t=0}^{\text{S Chain Uptime}\left(\infty\right)} f(\text{protocol rewards} \times t) + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} f(\text{trading profits} \times t)\right]$$




I hope you understand what this formula means. Since remaining supply will always decrease, price of $SNC will go up.
as you may see from below formula when we decrease remaining supply, price goes up.

$$\text{Price} = \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Remaining Supply}}$$


That's not all. Once $SNC Launches, I'll publish $SNC Lite Assistant on TradingView for free.
Trading can be most lonely job, therefore this assistant will lead you about market structure. If its ranging, trending up or trending down.
Sometimes it throws phrases.
Also most important, it will warn you about potential whale activity or increasing volume via calls.
These alone doesn't mean buy/sell signals, however if you are able to support it with your TA, surely it will boost your trading edge and R:R.
You can check below.

If it doesn't impress you, I don't know what else will.
Indicator mostly developed for Bitcoin, fine on indices, it works on other commoditiy, forex markets as well but with less given directions and calls.  

**But how it detects calls ?**
Well it doesn't surely detect whales since CEXs don't share volume or order data.
But there is a way to potentially catch smart money.
I'll not give TA lesson here but shortly:
There are 2 traders in market. 1 passive traders who put limit order, 2 active traders who put market orders. 
Normal volume calculates all trades, meanwhile cumulative volume delta only calculates market orders. 

Codes work as follow: 
higher volume than usual average + higher price volatility than usual change + candle close is green + cumulative volume delta is red
vice versa

So what to understand from here? 
volume is high, it means a lot of trades are going on, CVD is red which means there were more market sellers than market buyer volume but then how candle close is green ???
If CVD is red but candle is green, this means big limit orders were absorbing those market sellers. Therefore, even tho market buyers had less volume, they were able to push candle to green.

We see this type of behavior when smart money catches or absorbs orders of retail traders.
