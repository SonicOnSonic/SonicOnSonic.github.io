### I've seen Gen1 memecoins fall. 

No matter what they do. Simply because they only depend on hype, community, pump and dump. 
So, as a profitable algo trader, I thought why I just don't create a memecoin that doesn't depend on anything, anyone. 
Logic was simple but hard to achieve, a memecoin that doesn't get flatlined. It shouldn't depend on its community, even own developer.

**As you can see below, all Gen1 memecoins shared same destiny.**

![Lifecycle](/assets/img/1_lifecycle_of_memes.png)



To change the twisted game of memecoins, I decided to build a self-sufficient Gen2 memecoin. 
As you may know, serious projects start with a budget. To be used on team, marketing, costs of VMs etc.
While memecoins launch with almost $0 cost. 

{: .box-note}
**Note:** $SNC is neither of them, or maybe both. 

You heard plant Terrarium experiment right? Where David Latimer put some soil, fertilizer, plant and water. Where ecosystem grewup by itself.
Roughly, $SNC is crypto version of that. Its only on Sonic $S chain. Its built on $S because it best and fastest tech out there.

### Income Methods : 

**1-** I put some amount of money (which I totally erased and forgot from my life) to a lot of $S protocols and dApps to earn passively.

**2-** Coded a trading strategy on TradingView, connected that to Binance via API Signals. Which trades Bitcoin. 

**3-** Will be proposed to holders' decision after launch...

rewards which are received via these sources are in use to buy back & burn $SNC autonomously by wallet which ends with (...ddaa7)
**You don't need to chase KOLs, hype, cults, communities, raids or whatever you call. $SNC works for you while you spend no effort.**


{: .box-success}
Currently, this mechanism is not fully autonomous and still requires a server to run, and sometimes dev intervention. However, I contacted with Rabby Wallet team. Requested a feature which they also found logical. If this feature will be deployed, then $SNC buy back & burn mechanism will be fully autonomous and independent. Even if dev gets in coma, no worries. It will work as long as $S chain is up and Bitcoin is alive. 







**Below you can see the mechanism behind $SNC**

![Burn](/assets/img/3_SNC_burn_scheme.png)




In situations of no buyers, no hype, no community $SNC will work for increasing its price while reducing the supply, thanks to the its self-sufficient mechanism.
Do you know what that means? If we prolong this for enough time, in theory its market cap can pass all other memecoins.
Mentalities:
- River cuts through rock, not because of its power but because of its persistence.
- Step by step walk thousand-mile road.



You can check out below formulas

$$\text{SNC Total Supply} - \left[\sum_{t=0}^{\text{S Chain Uptime}\left(\infty\right)} f(\text{protocol rewards} \times t) + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} f(\text{trading profits} \times t)\right]$$




I hope you understand what this formula means. Since remaining supply will always decrease, price of $SNC will go up.
as you may see from below formula when we decrease remaining supply, price goes up.

$$\text{Price} = \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Remaining Supply}}$$


That's not all. Once $SNC Launches, I'll publish $SNC Lite Assistant on TradingView for free.
Trading can be most lonely job, therefore this assistant will lead you about market structure. If its ranging, trending up or trending down.
Sometimes it throws phrases.

Also most importantly, it will warn you about potential whale activity or increasing volume via calls.
These alone doesn't mean buy/sell signals, however if you are able to support it with your TA, surely it will boost your trading edge and R:R.
You can check below.

If it doesn't impress you, I don't know what else will.
Indicator mostly developed for Bitcoin, fine on indices, it works on other commoditiy, forex markets as well but with less given directions and calls.  

**But how it detects calls ?**
Well it doesn't surely detect whales since CEXs don't share volume or order data.
But there is a way to potentially catch smart money.
I'll not give TA lesson here but shortly:
There are 2 traders in market. 1 passive traders who put limit order, 2 active traders who put market orders. 
Normal volume calculates all trades, meanwhile cumulative volume delta only calculates market orders. 

Codes work as follow: 
higher volume than usual average + higher price volatility than usual change + candle close is green + cumulative volume delta is red
vice versa

So what to understand from here? 
volume is high, it means a lot of trades are going on, CVD is red which means there were more market sellers than market buyer volume but then how candle close is green ???
If CVD is red but candle is green, this means big limit orders were absorbing those market sellers. Therefore, even tho market buyers had less volume, they were able to push candle to green.

We see this type of behavior when smart money catches or absorbs orders of retail traders.

### Relief Fund Airdrops
Let's assume you lost money while trading SNC. Even if you know by time buy back & burn mechanism will push it up, you still want your money back right now.
Some of profits will be directed to relieve fund, which will be used for traders who lost money while trading SNC.
For security, this fund only will be directed to traders whose loss is visible on dexscreener, and will be sent to exact wallet only. Due to risk of impersonating as trader in loss, and asking money to different address.
If you got me, I got you.
Of course this airdrops can't cover everyone in loss, atleast while profitable holders are happy, SNC will try to relieve some of holders which got loss. Transparently with sharing txns.

# FAQs

{: .box-warning}
1- If you are profitable algo trader why bother to earn from a coin, why you just don't use it for yourself? 

{: .box-success}
I do use a lot of different bots for myself for a lot of different markets. Just wanted make a difference. Since, I use algorithms to trade and don't execute my trades by myself, I had plenty of free time. Decided to level up memecoins, and enjoy with $S community. As I previously mentioned about terrarium experiment. Wanted to do one and just have fun




{: .box-warning}
2- What happens if your trade bot loses its trading capital? Then it no longer has profits generated to buy back & Burn SNC. 

{: .box-success}
GREAT QUESTION ! Thats what I expect people to come with.
When market conditions change (in volatile or too slow conditions) it may stop performing profitable for a month. 
Backtests for last 3 years showed that it would averagely perform with 3-4% profit. And maximum equity drawdown seems 6% (If would use 20x leverage it could get liquidated)
However, we use 3x leverage on SNC Trade Bot, which technically means it can lose 18% of its capital in a row.
Also added a safety mechanism. So, capital doesn't decrease. If it doesn't increase balance for the month, it will not withdraw any money via API but will let trade bot turn back to its main capital.
Past performance is not guarantee of future performance, because markets always change. 
If it becomes unprofitable, Iâ€™ll have to optimize its strategy and should do backtests/forwardtests as well. Once I see its profitable again, I would add another capital which I erased from my life and investing in project-meme budget.
However, no worries about trade bot because it also has income from DeFi rewards on S dApps




{: .box-warning}
3- If marketcap reaches to a point where buy back & burn mechanism becomes less effective?

{: .box-success}
To reach this point, there is long way to go. According to estimate calculations this would happen once it passes 3M marketcap, however I still have plan for it.
If we see this mechanism effecting price less and less, 15% of profits from Income sources will be re-used to grow its capital by itself. Therefore increasing its incomes.




{: .box-warning}
4- Why should I trust you?

{: .box-success}
Because, I will be totally transparent and always co-operative. Even if it reaches point where we can't dream, instead of getting cocky I'll stay humble and always will answer any questions in your mind.
You will always be able to reach me. 




{: .box-warning}
5- What if I lose money trading SNC?

{: .box-success}
If you got me, I got you. Will create a relieve fund from incomes to cover losses of some traders atleast. 
I will go 10 steps to who comes 1 step towards me. 




{: .box-warning}
6- I'm not sure to connect my wallet to sonicx.fun

{: .box-success}
Well, you can create 2nd wallet for trading tokens. You can deposit very little amount of $S and try that out, without any hesitation.
